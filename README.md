### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Anton.

I'm a Software Engineer and an Online Entrepreneur. This is my GitHub space where I share the coding bits of my work online.


These days I mainly work on [DevSkills](https://devskills.co). It is a platform which provides technical assessment as a standalone service. The platform covers multiple use-cases, e.g. coding interviews, developer portfolios, candidate tech profiles. etc.

DevSkills a bootstrapped project and I'm currently running it solo.

I also [hang out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fenskexyz) where I post behind-the-scenes of working on DevSkills.
