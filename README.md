### Hi there! 👋 I'm Anton.

I'm a Software Engineer and Entrepreneur.

This is my GitHub space where you can find some interesting bits about my career as well as the content I make.

These days I mainly work on DevSkills. It is a real-world developer assessment platform that can make it really easy for you to tell whether someone got practical coding skills.

I also hang out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fenskexyz) and [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/fenske) where I post the behind-the-scenes of working on DevSkills.

Don't hesitate to give me a shot and share what you're up to. ✌️
