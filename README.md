### Hi there! 👋 I'm Anton.

This is my GitHub space where you can find some interesting bits about what I do as well as the code I write.

Last two years I spent building [DevSkills](http://devskills.co/) which was eventually acquired by [Alva Labs](alvalabs.io) in September 2022. And Alva is where I spend most of my working hours nowadays running a coding tests team there.  

I also hang out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fenskexyz) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fenske/) where I post the behind-the-scenes of working on DevSkills.

Don't hesitate to give me a shout and share what you're up for. ✌️
