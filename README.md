### Hi there! 👋 I'm Anton.

I'm a Software Engineer and an Online Entrepreneur.


These days I mainly work on [DevSkills](https://devskills.co). It's a bootstrapped project which I'm currently running solo.

This is my GitHub space where I share the coding bits of my work online.

I also [hang out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fenskexyz) where I post behind-the-scenes of working on DevSkills.
