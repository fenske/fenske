### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Anton.

Welcome to my GitHub space! Here, you'll find a collection of projects and code snippets that showcase my work.

From 2020 to 2022, I built [DevSkills](https://devskills.co/), which was acquired by [Alva Labs](https://alvalabs.io) in September 2022. Currently, I spend most of my time at Alva Labs, where I work as the CTO.

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fenskexyz) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fenske/), where I share behind-the-scenes insights into my projects and daily work.

Feel free to reach out and let me know what you're working on or just to say hi!
