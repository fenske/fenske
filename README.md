### Hi there! 👋 I'm Anton.

I'm a Software Engineer and Entrepreneur.

This is my GitHub space where you can find some interesting bits about what I do as well as the code I write.

These days I mainly work on [DevSkills](http://devskills.co/). It used to be my pet project which grew into a full-time endeavor. 

DevSkills is a real-world coding test platform that that makes it crystal clear if someone got the necessary practical coding skills.

I also hang out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fenskexyz) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fenske/) where I post the behind-the-scenes of working on DevSkills.

Don't hesitate to give me a shout and share what you're up for. ✌️
