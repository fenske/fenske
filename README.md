### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Anton.

This is my GitHub space where you can find some interesting bits about what I do and the code I write.

Between 2020-2022 I built [DevSkills](https://devskills.co/) which was eventually acquired by [Alva Labs](https://alvalabs.io) in September 2022. And Alva is where I spend most of my working hours nowadays running a coding tests team there.  

I also hang out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fenskexyz) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fenske/) where I post the behind-the-scenes of my work.

Don't hesitate to give me a shout and share what you're up for.
