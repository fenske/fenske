### Hi there! 👋 I'm Anton.

I'm a Software Engineer and Entrepreneur.

This is my GitHub space where you can find some interesting bits about what I do as well as the code I write.

These days I mainly work on [DevSkills](http://devskills.co/). It used to be my pet project which grew into a full-time endeavor. DevSkils is a real-world developer assessment infrastructure that can make it really easy for you to tell whether someone got practical coding skills.

I also hang out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fenskexyz) and [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/fenske) where I post the behind-the-scenes of working on DevSkills.

Don't hesitate to give me a shout and share what you're up to. ✌️
